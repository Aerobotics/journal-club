Our entry is based on "Fully Convolutional Instance-aware Semantic Segmentation[a]". It is a fully convolutional end-to-end solution for instance aware semantic segmentation. The proposed method is much faster and more accurate than the previous challenge winning Multi-task Network Cascade method. We utilize an ensemble of ResNet models, which are pre-trained on ImageNet, and finetuned on COCO trainval. Code would be released at https://github.com/daijifeng001/TA-FCN.
